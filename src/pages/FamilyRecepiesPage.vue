              This recipe has been a closely guarded secret in my family for
              years. It was handed down to me by my Aunt Phoebe, who believes that
              chocolate cake has the power to heal broken hearts... or at least
              make them forget for a little while.
            </p>
  
            <h4>When is it usually prepared?</h4>
            <p>
              We bake this chocolate cake whenever there's a reason to celebrate -
              birthdays, anniversaries, or simply surviving another week of work.
            </p>
  
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
              <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
              <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>2 eggs</li>
              <li>1 cup milk</li>
              <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
              <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            </ul>
  
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease and flour two 9-inch
                round cake pans.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking
                powder, baking soda, and salt.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat the mixture on
                medium speed for about 2 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that's
                normal.
              </li>
              <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
              <li>
                Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the
                center comes out clean.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans
                for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool
                completely.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once cooled, you can frost and decorate the cake as desired.

              I learned this baked potato recipe during a cooking challenge with
              my best friend Rachel. It was a battle of culinary skills, and I
              emerged victorious with this crispy-on-the-outside,
              fluffy-on-the-inside masterpiece.
            </p>
            <h4>When is it usually prepared?</h4>
            <p>
              Whenever we need a comforting side dish, like when Ross is having a
              "We were on a break" moment.
            </p>
  
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Large baking potatoes</li>
              <li>Olive oil</li>
              <li>Salt and pepper</li>
              <li>
                Toppings of your choice (sour cream, butter, cheese, bacon bits,
                chives, etc.)
              </li>

            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash the potatoes and pat them
                dry.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rub each potato with olive oil, then season generously with salt
                and pepper.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a fork to pierce the potatoes in a few places to allow steam
                to escape.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender
                when pierced with a fork.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool for a few
                minutes.
              </li>
              <li>Slice open each potato and fluff the insides with a fork.</li>
              <li>
                Add your favorite toppings, such as sour cream, butter, cheese,
                bacon bits, chives, or any other desired toppings.
              </li>
              <li>Serve the baked potatoes as a side dish or a main course.</li>

              Ah, Thanksgiving, the holiday where I prove to everyone that I can
              roast a turkey better than anyone else. This recipe has been handed
              down in my family for generations, and it never fails to impress.
            </p>
  
            <h4>When is it usually prepared?</h4>
  
            <p>
              Thanksgiving is the grand event where this majestic bird takes
              center stage, surrounded by all the traditional fixings and a side
              of sibling rivalry.
            </p>
  
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>1 turkey (12-14 pounds)</li>
              <li>Salt and pepper</li>
              <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
              <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
              <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
              <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
              <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
              <li>Fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, sage)</li>
              <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            </ul>
  
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Remove the giblets and neck
                from the turkey cavity and rinse the turkey with cold water.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and season the cavity with
                salt and pepper.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a roasting pan, place the quartered onion, chopped celery,
                carrot, and minced garlic.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a small bowl, combine the softened butter with chopped fresh
                herbs, salt, and pepper. Rub the mixture all over the turkey,
                including under the skin.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place the turkey on top of the vegetables in the roasting pan and
                pour the chicken broth into the pan.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover the turkey with foil and roast for about 3 to 3 1/2 hours,
                basting occasionally with the pan juices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking to allow the
                turkey to brown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. It should
                reach 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the thigh.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once cooked, remove the turkey from the oven, tent it with foil,
                and let it rest for about 20 minutes before carving.
